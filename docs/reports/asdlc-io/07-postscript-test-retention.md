# Postscript: delivery checks and lasting regression guards

Added 12 November 2026 after the designer highlighted the KonMari work. This supplements the original assessment; it does not propose changes to Void Drift or reopen its test suite.

## What the original assessment covered

The two KonMari skills and pruning records appeared in the source inventories. The assessment discussed proportional verification, maintenance costs and separate review captures, but did not directly assess these skills or the browser-pruning episode. The distinction below was therefore underdeveloped in the synthesis.

The five project sources read for this postscript match their bytes at the original assessment baseline, `49336a6e5675da1b50b7179f3baaf28f6d3a7bb4`. This is an extension of evidence selection, not incorporation of later product changes.

Temporary defect probes tested retained sensitivity. This historical outcome section provides counterevidence to equating pruning with fewer lines or treating every development probe as permanent infrastructure. The plan's proposals are not current authority. |

These are inspected procedures and historical reports, not a fresh rerun or an independent reconstruction of every deleted test. E-K03 also records a failed full unit run and a passing focused rerun; the latter does not turn the former into a pass.

## PS-F01 — Test creation and test retention are different decisions

**Finding:** A test can help establish that an agent's current change behaves as intended without offering enough continuing regression protection to justify its maintenance. Conversely, a test written during implementation may also be an excellent lasting guard. Origin alone does not decide retention.

The case separates three purposes:

- **Development verification:** bounded checks and probes that inform the current implementation decision.
- **Regression protection:** retained tests that detect significant unintended failures which other checks would miss.
- **Review evidence:** captures or demonstrations that help inspect a result without becoming required correctness gates.

The primary economic distinction is maintenance—future edits, false alarms, attention and agent work—not simply test execution time. A test that restates today's configuration may demand repairs whenever intended behavior evolves while protecting little independent intent. The KonMari procedures make that trade-off explicit and preserve meaningful protection within mixed tests before removing surrounding demonstrations.

**Limits:** Confidence is high that this distinction is deliberately encoded and applied in the recorded browser review. Its long-term effect on defects, maintenance or costs is not measured. The designer's suggestion that agents created tests mainly to complete their immediate tasks is a plausible explanation, consistent with the skills' framing; individual agent motives were not reconstructed. Removal counts are outcomes, not proof of improved quality or a deletion target.

## PS-P01 — Document how tests earn continued retention

**Targets:** ASDLC.io's [Theory of LLM Constraints](https://asdlc.io/concepts/theory-of-llm-constraints/), proportional verification; [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/), quality gates; and [Feature Assembly](https://asdlc.io/practices/feature-assembly/), verification. These refer to the original captured guidance edition, especially G-G05/09/14.

The guidance already says additional gates should protect named risks and earn their place. This case supplies a more granular application: **a required test gate does not make every test inside it worth retaining**.

Proposed wording for review:

> Verification written while delivering a change and regression protection retained afterward serve different purposes. Retain a test when it protects a significant behavioral contract, adds protection beyond existing checks, and warrants its continuing maintenance. Preserve useful delivery evidence without automatically turning every demonstration into a permanent gate.

A worked example could contrast a test that pins a configured value with one that detects a saved preference failing to reach the actual runtime. Include explicit automation gaps and preserve product acceptance behavior when tests are removed. Do not prescribe removal quotas, require moving every discarded test to another suite, or imply that only previously observed bugs deserve guards.

This is an additional framework-documentation proposal, not adopted policy. It complements F-03, F-07 and P-04/P-08 in the main assessment. Validation beyond this case would need evidence about maintenance and escaped regressions over time, not just before/after suite size.
